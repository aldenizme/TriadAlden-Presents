Evening docks, my aunt get home from work, a rhetoric question follows, "Exams zishaisha" which translates to, are you done with your exams, I answer yes and she askes me a question that its answer 
I believe is always a crusifiction answer that you will come to know why I say so in a while. The question was, "How was the exams and what grade do you see yourself getting". Well for me, just like the
ancient proverb of " Dont count your chicks when they are not yet hatched", I just had  not tangible answer but instaed I said it was tough just to set myself in some safe position incase things turn out to be 
of worse case scenarios. Everyone else with good exposure always know this is a kind of a question you cannot just answer with so much confidence. She finally shrugs the story away and reminds me of my cousine Shirley
who was also doing her KCSE at that time and was just some days from completing her exams now that she was doing French and the exams were spposed to be done in some days after us Physists had finished ours.
At the same time, my other cousine Denzel was already dome with his exams prior and had travelled to Nairobi at that time. She had asked him about the same question and he had also replied just like me. She tell me that 
all will be well and ma we saw what we ripe and the conversation dies there.
