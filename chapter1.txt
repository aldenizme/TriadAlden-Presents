This is the start of my adulthood story. The year is 2019, I am done with my high school life as most would call it in the Kenyan context.
All looks merry when you leave the school gates with all you hava ever had in the four years that you have been locked up with rules and regulations.
For most the rules especially now that you are just hitting your puberty and all that, you start to feel like you
are a full grown man and seeing a fellow grown man(teachers) tryin to set rules for you and enforce them on you becomes something
that most deam as impossible. From mandatory "Always be on the move" to "Form X will be cleaning the dormitories today" to
 "You did not do your manual work today and therefore go see the teacher on duty" to some other strict rules that it's now that we 
 are coming to the realisation that they were very crucial for building the discipline that you need in the outside world to be 
 of importance to yourself and the world as a whole
